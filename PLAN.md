# Plan: racetimer — two-receiver "through the gate" validation

## Context

Normal FPV lap timers use one receiver per gate and count a lap on the RSSI peak,
so a quad flying close *over* or *under* the gate still counts. Idea: put two
Widscan58 receivers (ESP32-C5, https://github.com/CapnBry/widscan58) on each gate,
one on the top bar and one on the bottom bar, and only accept a pass when both see
the quad strongly at the same moment with a balanced top/bottom level. A cheap
ESP32-WROOM per gate is the "brain": it reads both C5s over UART, decides pass /
over / under, and serves a live web UI for testing. Channels: Raceband R1, R3, R6,
R8.

Widscan58 already does all the radio work (`METRICS RSSI` mode streams compact
`FRAME_LEVELS` per hop; `firmware/src/scan/lap.c` does RotorHazard-style pass
detection) but only talks over USB Serial/JTAG (`firmware/src/proto/link.c`),
which a WROOM can't host. So the work is: a small transport change in a fork, plus
a new project for the gate controller.

## Repos and licensing

1. **Fork** `CapnBry/widscan58` → `geekhostuk/widscan58`, branch `uart-link`.
   Minimal, upstream-friendly diff; offer it back as a PR to CapnBry.
2. **New repo** `geekhostuk/racetimer` (this directory, currently empty).
   - The fork is a git submodule at `third_party/widscan58` (pinned commit).
   - **GPL-3.0-or-later** for the whole repo: the gate firmware compiles
     widscan58's `lap.c`/`frames.h`, which are GPL.
   - Credit: README "Credits" section naming Widscan58 and CapnBry with a link,
     plus C5VRX / esp-sdr that Widscan58 credits; GPL headers kept on any
     copied/derived file ("Derived from Widscan58 …").

## Milestone 1 — C5 fork: UART link (`geekhostuk/widscan58@uart-link`)

- `firmware/src/proto/link.c`: add a build option `LINK_UART` (new PlatformIO env
  `esp32c5_uart`; Kconfig/`-D` for TX pin, RX pin, baud, default 2 000 000).
  Swap `usb_serial_jtag_driver_install / _write_bytes / _read_bytes` for
  `uart_driver_install / uart_write_bytes / uart_read_bytes`. The rest of
  `link.c` (ring buffer queue, `link_task`, drop counter) stays as is. Default
  build stays USB, so upstream behaviour is unchanged.
- Protocol is unchanged: ASCII commands in, ASCII replies + binary frames out
  (`frames.h`: `0xA5 'R' type ver len payload crc32`). The board boots waiting in
  RotorHazard mode; the WROOM sends `PROTOCOL MONITOR`, then the channel list,
  `METRICS RSSI`, RX gain, and turns spectrum/telemetry streaming off. (Exact
  command syntax to be confirmed from `proto/commands.c` while implementing.)
- **Throughput check:** a `FRAME_LEVELS` hop is ~46 bytes; with R1/R3/R6/R8
  (4 LOs, ~2 ms per sweep) that's ~2000 hops/s ≈ 90 KB/s. That's why the baud
  is 2 Mbaud, not 921600. If `link_drops()` climbs, add a `LEVELS EVERY n`
  decimation command (small, also useful upstream).
- Verify the XIAO ESP32-C5 pin numbers for the UART TX/RX (D6/D7) on hardware.

## Milestone 2 — gate controller reads both C5s + live web UI

- `c5_link.c`: one instance per C5 (top on UART2, bottom on UART1; avoid
  GPIO 6–11). Byte-wise frame parser with CRC32 check (`esp_rom_crc32_le`),
  decodes `frame_levels_t` / `frame_level_t` from the submodule's `frames.h`
  (no copied structs). Sends setup commands at boot and when settings change;
  re-sends if a board stops streaming for >1 s (C5 reboot/brown-out).
- Timestamps: put both boards on the WROOM's clock. Keep a running
  `offset = min(rx_time_us − t_ms·1000)` per board and convert each hop's
  `t_ms`. Good to ~1 ms, plenty for pairing.
- `web.c`: Wi-Fi AP by default (`racegate-XXXX`, works at a field with no
  internet), optional STA from settings. HTTP serves `index.html`; one
  WebSocket pushes level batches at ~30 Hz (max per channel per board over each
  window) and pass events as they happen. No CDN: plain JS + canvas.
- UI page: per channel (R1/R3/R6/R8) top and bottom traces plus the delta trace;
  pass list with verdict; settings panel (gain, enter/exit, delta limit, pair
  window, channels); "Record" button that saves the session as CSV in the
  browser; board status (frames/s, drops, saturation flag).

## Milestone 3 — pass detection + fusion

- Per board per channel: one widscan58 `lap.c` instance (median or EMA filter,
  enter_at/exit_at), fed from the decoded levels. Reuse it instead of writing a
  new detector.
- `gate_fusion.c` (pure C, no ESP-IDF calls):
  - Pair a top pass and a bottom pass on the same channel within ±75 ms
    (configurable).
  - Δ = (top peak − bottom peak) − calibrated offset, in dB (codes / 4).
  - **VALID** if both peaks ≥ enter_at and |Δ| ≤ delta_max (start ~6 dB);
    **OVER** if Δ > delta_max; **UNDER** if Δ < −delta_max; **SINGLE** if only one
    board saw it (rejected but shown).
  - Lap time = mean of the two pass times; minimum lap time rejection.
- Calibration: "Calibrate" button averages Δ over the next N centre passes into a
  per-gate offset, stored in NVS.

## Milestone 4 — field test (decides the antenna and thresholds)

Record in this order: omni antennas first, then inward-facing patches (top points
down, bottom points up). Fly centre, near the top bar inside, just over the top
bar, near the bottom bar inside, under the gate. Use `tools/plot_log.py` to see
whether VALID and OVER/UNDER separate, then set `delta_max` and the antenna
choice. Write the results into `docs/hardware.md`.

**Later, out of scope for now:** several gates sending to one server, clock sync
between gates, RotorHazard plugin.

## Verification

- **Fork:** build `esp32c5_uart`; connect a USB-UART adapter at 2 Mbaud;
  `tools/c5_frames.py` shows ~500 updates/s per channel with valid CRCs, and
  `STATUS` reports zero link drops over 10 min. The default USB build still works
  with the Widscan58 web UI.
- **Fusion:** `pio test -e native` with synthetic two-trace cases: centre pass →
  VALID, top-heavy → OVER, bottom-heavy → UNDER, one-sided → SINGLE, peaks
  100 ms apart → not paired, plus calibration offset applied.
- **Bench:** two C5s + WROOM wired on a desk, a low-power VTX on R1 moved by hand
  past each antenna. The UI shows both traces, Δ swings the right way, and the
  verdicts match.
- **Field:** Milestone 4 recordings; every deliberate over/under pass rejected and
  every centre pass accepted before calling it done.

## Status (2026-10-23)

- Milestone 1: done, not yet run on hardware. Fork branch `uart-link`
  (`LINK_UART`, env `esp32c5_uart`) builds; the default `esp32c5` build and
  upstream's host tests still pass.
- Milestones 2 and 3: written and build for the WROOM (`gate/`). Fusion host
  tests pass (`pio test -e native`, 14 cases). The web UI was checked against
  `tools/gate_sim.py` in headless Chromium (light, dark, 390 px phone width).
- Next: bench test with real boards (Verification), then Milestone 4.
